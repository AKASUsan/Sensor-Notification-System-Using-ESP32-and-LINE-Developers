# Sensor-Notification-System-Using-ESP32-and-LINE-Developers
Notice

This code is a mini project created as a sensor system. It is not designed for real-world deployment, but it works to some extent. For larger projects, it is not recommended in its current form, though it can be further developed and improved.

Please note:

LINE allows only 300 messages per month. If you plan to use this, set the delay to more than 10 seconds to avoid issues.

If multiple people are detected at the same time, the system may not work correctly.

Feel free to adjust and modify it according to your own purposes.
Thank you for using it! üôè
